This is an attempt at an *enhanced/updated/modified/edited_to_fits_my_needs* version of UkeGeeks    
(since the original doesn't seems to accept pull request since early 2015).

# Installation

Nothing special here, you need Apache / Php.  
Mod_rewrite is really recommended too (for prettier url).

Just download the source and unzip-it (or use git clone) on your hosting space.

**Important : By default, the Songbook assumes that it's installed in your web server's root directory.**
If you want to change this, read below (installing in a different directory).

## Setup username, preferences

- **Step 1** : Rename the file **/ugsphp/conf/config.php_example** to **config.php** and edit-it to suits your needs (username, passwords, language, private/public mode, etc)
- **Step 2** : Rename the **/ugsphp/conf/settings.js_example** to **settings.js** and edit-it to suits your preferences (diagram size, position, default theme, ...).
- **Step 3** : Rename **htaccess.txt** to **.htaccess**

And that's it, you should be good to go. Start adding songs :)

### Optional

#### Optional : installing in a different directory
The Songbook assumes that it's installed in your web server's root directory, but you might want it in a subdirectory. Perhaps you want the URLs to be "mysite.com/hobbies/ukulele/music.php", for example. Excellent! To do this we just need to open config.php and change the subdirectory.

By default this is set to the root:

    static private Subdirectory = '/';
    
You can just modify it to whatever you wish (include leading and trailing last forward slashes "/")

    static private Subdirectory = '/hobbies/ukulele/';

If you installed UkeGeeks-ng to a subdirectory, you have to modify the **.htaccess** file :
- Change the **ErrorDocument** to the correct path of your install.
- Change the line **RewriteBase** to the correct path of your install.
